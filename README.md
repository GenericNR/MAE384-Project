# MAE384-Project
This is a group project

The guidelines for the project are in Project.pdf

The central program will be Group_Project.mlx


NOTE TO TEAM: for simplicity's sake, use Q# for your script, and then add it to Group_Project.mlx


Group_Project.mlx can be edited directly in GitHub so no need to download it. Also, for new scripts if values from previous questions are needed, do:


    set(0,'DefaultFigureVisible','off')

    Q#; % This is whatever script you want to load

    set(0,'DefaultFigureVisible','on')


as this will load a script but not display any plots/figures.
